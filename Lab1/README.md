In Chapter One, the importance of Computer Science was first discussed. Computers and similar technology exist in many aspects in life that may not be immediately realized. From advanced computers in modern cars, to mini-computers in washing machines, computers play a key role within society. But how do these computers function and operate in a useful way? Computers are composed of general two main components: Hardware and Software. Without software, hardware would simply be a series of circuits. However, through communication with software, hardware can be useful. Therefore, in order to achieve impact, programming languages were created. 

Furthermore, the chapter discussed the basic fundamental principles of Python. Python is a programming language that is used both in small and large organizations. Essentially, everything in Python is considered an "object". Every object has three characteristics: identity, type, and value. Numbers, for example, can be represented in three different ways: integer numbers, floating point, and complex numbers. However, programmers can also assign information to "variables". If a programmer chooses, he or she can assign a variable to a string (characters) or a number. In general, the Python translator reads, evaluates, and prints code. In addition the chapter also introduced concepts such as dereferencing and abstraction!

i) What are Primitive Elements?
Primitive elements are objects in Python that are capable of storing a single value. These elements are the most basic and are seperated into four variable types: Integers, Floats, Strings, and Boolean. In this chapter, we've discussed the three types of object classifications of numbers. Numbers in Python can be represented as an integer, floating point, or a complex nubmer. 

ii) How can we combine primitive elements?
We can combine primitive elements by using assignment statements/variables

iii) What number is represented by 319e5?
Answer: 4,335.67
