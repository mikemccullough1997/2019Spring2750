Chapter Two of Introduction to Scripting covers more problem strategies that integrate real life siutations that can be used within Python. Early in the chapter, we evaluate pi and how it can be used within Python when used with the import math module. Many modules within the math module itself can be used, such as acos(), asin(), sqrt(), and a number of others. Throughout the chapter, we're introduced with many mathematical situations and formulas that can be used within Python. By using formulas, like The Wallis Formula, Python can create a function that can be used numerous times to output specific results. This problem solving method certainly increases efficiency and also accuracy. Lastly, towards the end of the chapter, we are introduced to boolean (true or false statements) expressions and different rational operators like >, <=, and != and how they are implemented within code.
