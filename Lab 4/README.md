3) In chapter 4, we learned about data and how it can be affected by natural disasters such as earthquakes. There are several. Data can be manipulated and analyzed in many ways. If necessary, a user can find the mean, median, mode, and other measures of central tendency. In terms of using Python, lists can assist a programmer with finding these measures. Lists are very similar to strings, however, lists are heterogeneous and can be composed of any kind of object. Furthermore, this chapter also discusses how we can use dictionaries to find frequency distribution, mode, etc. In conclusion, this chapter covered three more data types that allow programmers to solve problems.
